This guide explains CLI commands to manage your **local keys** and **wallet addresses** with the **keyring** manager.  

## Key CLI

```

The following commands are available:

|Command | Description |

|  add   |      Add an encrypted private key (either newly generated or recovered), encrypt it, and save to `YOUR-FILE-NAME` |
|  delete  |    Delete the given keys |
|  export   |   Export private keys |
| import   |   Import private keys into the local keybase |
|  list    |    List all keys |
|  migrate   |  Migrate keys from the legacy (db-based) Keybase |
|  mnemonic  |  Compute the bip39 mnemonic for some input entropy |

## Keys Help 

Use the following command to get detailed information on all available `key` commands. 

```shell
fetchd keys --help
```

## List all keys

Use this command to list all local keys managed by `fetchd` key manager. 

```shell 
fetchd keys list
```

## Add a new key

Use this command to add a new key in the keyring.

:::caution Key naming
***REMEMBER*** to use a name that helps you recall the key and its purpose later. 
:::

In this example, we are adding the key 'memorable-key-name' to the `keyring` with a backend configured to our `os`. 

```shell
fetchd keys add memorable-key-name --keyring-backend os
```

### Example

```shell
$ fetchd keys add salsa
- name: salsa
  type: local
  address: fetch1qr5rt72yf7s340123456dne7dd5n3
  pubkey: fetchpub1addwnpep1234abcdefg540ftuz8x6tsqdct05k
  mnemonic: ""
  threshold: 0
  pubkeys: []

**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

random words there are twelve or twenty-four
```

:::warning

It is important that you keep the mnemonic for address secure, as there is no way to recover it. You would not be able to recover and access the funds in the wallet if you forget the mnemonic phrase.
