A **Delegator** is someone who delegates (stakes) tokens to one or more **Validator nodes** of their choice. In return, they receive a share of block rewards. 

Delegating additional tokens to a **Validator node** contributes to increasing the validatorsâ€™ **Voting Power**. The validators with the most **Voting Power** are selected more often to **propose blocks** and therefore earn more rewards. 

Tokens delegated to a **Validator node** are kept in a pool. The Validator and its Delegators share rewards based on the amounts they have contributed to this pool.

Tokens remain on the Delegator's wallets but can only be accessed again once **un-delegated**. The un-delegation process is quick and easy to perform but there is an **unbonding period of 21 days**, usually, before tokens are released. 

Delegators can also participate in governance. Voting Power is proportional to the amount staked.

## How to choose a validator to delegate to

Deciding on a validator to delegate to can be a tricky decision.

It is essential to DYOR (Do Your Own Research) and to continue to monitor the validator(s) you have chosen. If your active validator misbehaves there is the possibility of losing delegated funds due to slashing. Sharing rewards also means sharing risks so it is important to carefully select validators based on criteria such as: **uptime**, **reliability** and **participation** in governance. 

* Check out useful metrics about uptime and participation for individual validators on [Mintscan](https://www.mintscan.io/fetchai/validators). 

* Check commission fees. Some validators offer zero commission to attract new delegators but these can change. 
The **max commission rate** is the upper bound of fees the validator can define, and the **max change rate** is the maximum fee they can change daily. 

* Check whether the validator has a public website and contact information available
whether email, Twitter or Telegram. 

* Choose more than one validator to delegate to. This increases the chances of one of your chosen validators being selected to validate and for you to receive rewards. 

## Key tips

1. Perform due diligence on Validators before committing funds. 

2. Monitor the Validator node including the commission rate.
