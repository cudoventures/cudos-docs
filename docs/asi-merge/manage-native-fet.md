There are two main ways to manage your new FET tokens.
Please read our [FET guide](https://www.cudos.org/blog/guide-to-access-and-manage-your-new-fet-tokens) for a more comprehensive description and step-by-step guide.

### [Cosmostation wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cosmostation-wallet/fpkhgmpbidmiogeglndfbkegfdlnajnf) + [Mintscan](https://www.mintscan.io/)

A great way to see your vesting schedule, manage your tokens (including staking and unstaking) and vote on proposals is by using the Cosmostation wallet, in combination with Mintscan.
To do so, please import your account into the Cosmostation wallet.

### [ASI Wallet](https://fetch.ai/docs/guides/fetch-network/fetch-wallet/web-wallet/get-started)

The ASI Wallet offers all of the required functionality: it correctly displays the vesting, and it allows you to perform all token actions, including staking and claiming rewards.
It's also the official wallet offered by the ASI Alliance.
To start using it, please import your account into it.

### [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/)

Keplr also supports the FET token, however the vesting schedule may not display correctly, and it doesn't link as well to Mintscan as the Cosmostation wallet does.
To add the ASI Alliance chain to you Keplr account to be able to see your FET tokens, please log in to [CUDOS Intercloud](https://intercloud.cudos.org/).
