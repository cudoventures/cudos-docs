The [CUDOS Explorer](https://explorer.cudos.org/) has been kept to ensure all users can see their final CUDOS balances, and let each user independently ensure that they received the correct amount of FET at the 118.344 rate.

An archive node has also been made publicly available, which allows historical queries on all blockchain data.
