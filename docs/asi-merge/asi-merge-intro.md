On September 11, 2024 CUDOS and ASI proposed the [integration of CUDOS into the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance](https://x.com/ASI_Alliance/status/1833945377332232206).
The voting on both sides ended on September 24, with an overwhelming majority of over 96% of votes in favour of the merger.

The public rate is 118.344 CUDOS : 1 FET, with a 3 months vesting schedule.

The [Ethereum portal to swap CUDOS for FET](https://singularitydao.ai/migrate-asi) opened on September 26, and the [blockchain merger was successfully completed on October 28](https://x.com/CUDOS_/status/1850907135078547632).

CUDOS no longer has a separate blockchain nor a separate token.
Native tokens have already been automatically converted as part of the blockchain merger, and ERC-20 tokens can be swapped in the [SingularityDAO platform](https://singularitydao.ai/migrate-asi) at any point in time.
