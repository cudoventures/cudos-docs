The following cryptography is used on the ASI Alliance network. 

## Digital Signatures

Digital Signatures are a cryptographic tool to sign messages and verify message signatures in order to provide proof of authenticity for all messages including transactions. 

Digital signatures provide:

1. **Message integrity** - A proof of the *integrity* of the data. Modification is not possible without access to the original sender's private key.  

2. **Message authentication** - A proof that only a certain known sender created and signed the message. The verifier has *assurance* of data origin authentication because the only way the digital signature could be decrypted is using the sender's private key. It is computationally infeasible to generate a valid signature for a party without knowing that party's private key.

3. **Non-repudiation** - The signer cannot deny signing the document after the signature is created. Anyone can verify the digital signature by computing a hash of the data and checking whether the decryption of the digital signature results in the same hash. 

ASI Alliance uses the [**ECDSA Elliptic Curve Digital Signature scheme**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm). This is a cryptographically secure digital signature scheme based on elliptic-curve cryptography. 

* The elliptic curve is `sepc2561k`
* The **private key** for signing messages is a random integer within the curve key length.
* The **public key** for verifying signatures is calculated from the private key by multiplying it to the curve generator point. 

## ECDSA Signing

The ECDSA signing process works as follows:

1. The ECDSA signing algorithm computes a message **hash**
2. A random integer **k** is generated
3. A **signature** is computed from (a pair of integers {r, s}), where 
    - **r** is computed from **k** and 
    - **s** is computed using the message **hash** + the **private key** + the random number **k**. 
    - Due to the randomness, the signature is **non-deterministic**.

## ECDSA Verifying 

The ECDSA signature verification algorithm involves computations, based on the message **hash** + the **public key** + the **signature {r, s}**.

The ECDSA key pairs generated via elliptic curve cryptography are smaller than the average keys generated by digital signing algorithms. The sender of a transaction signs it using their own private key. On-chain signature verification is enabled by storing the public key in the 'Account' object. See [Accounts](/docs/learn/concepts/account)

## Hash Functions

Hash functions transform input data of any size to a results of a fixed size. This output is the **hash**.

**SHA-2** is a family of strong cryptographic hash functions. More bits at the **hash output** achieve stronger security.

**SHA-256** is used to transform input data to a result of a fixed 256 bit output. Transaction hashes are all 256 bits.

## BIP 39

When you create a new wallet on ASI Alliance using the CLI, you are given a BIP39 mnemonic. 
BIP39 describes the implementation of a mnemonic code for the generation of deterministic wallets. 

It consists of two parts: 

### 1. Generating the mnemonic 

A 12 or 24 word mnemonic is randomly generated from the [**BIP39 wordlist comprising 2048 words**](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt). This may seem like a limited pool of words but the actual number of possible combinations makes it extremely secure. 

::: Probability and mnemonics

If a mnemonic were only 1 word, the odds of guessing someone's mnemonic would be 1 in 2048.

2048^1.

A 2 word mnemonic phrase would have ~4.2 million different possible combinations. A bit more secure. 

2048^2 = 4,194,304.

Skipping ahead to the 12 word mnemonic phrase... 

There are 54 quattuordecillion different possibilities. 

The number has 15 commas. 

2048^12 = 5.4445179e+39

### 2. Converting it into a binary seed 

Your mnemonic and an passphrase of your choice is converted into a binary seed using the [**PBKDF2 key derivation function**]. **PBKDF2** is resistant to [**dictionary and rainbow table attacks**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack). 

This binary seed supports deterministic key generation of wallet keypairs.
