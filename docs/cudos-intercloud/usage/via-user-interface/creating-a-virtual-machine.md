That will take you to the VM create page.
There you’ll be met with a variety of options that allow you to configure your machine’s specifications as you see fit, including:
- OS image.
    - Choose a popular image such as Ubuntu, or explore our GPU-focused images with Docker and the GPU drivers preinstalled, or ready with Stability.ai's software preinstalled.
- Region.
- Machine and GPU details.
- Storage.
- Networking.

Each step has an **(i)** icon which you can hover over for more information. 
Any discounts that may apply to your account will be shown on the pricing summary on the right hand side of the page.
