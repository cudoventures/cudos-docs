Identities on CUDOS Intercloud refer to the blockchain accounts added to your CUDOS Intercloud account. These are used for payments as well as VM management.

On this page you can see the current blockchain accounts you have added to your CUDOS Intercloud account.
All of them are shared within the account, and so VMs and payments can be managed by logging in with any of the accounts listed.
