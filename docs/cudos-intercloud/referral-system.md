# CUDOS Intercloud Referral System

Intercloud users have the ability to refer other users with their referral code, or a referral link.
Benefits include:
- Referrers typically receive between 1 and 1.5% of the usage of all users they have referred.
- Withdrawals are received in FET tokens.
- The minimum withdrawal amount is $15.
- Referral balance that is not withdrawn can be used as platform credit.

You can find the referral section under the payments section, in the top menu.

Referrals only go one level at the moment -- you do not earn referral commissions on users that are referred by a user you have referred.

## Sharing your referral link and code

To share your referral link, click on top of it in the `Overview` tab to copy it to the clipboard.
If you wish to send only your referral code, you can find that within your referral link -- it's the last part, highlighted in blue.
For example, if your referral link is `https://intercloud.cudos.org/?referrer=sample-referral-code-314159`, then your referral code would be `sample-referral-code-314159`.

## Withdrawing your referral money

You can withdraw your referral commissions from the `Overview` tab of the referral section.
Add in the USD amount you'd like to withdraw in the box, and then click on `Start withdrawal`.
When your lifetime referral earnings reach $15k, you will need undergo KYC to be able to withdraw all your referral funds.

## Seeing all the referral history

To see all your withdrawal history, navigate to the `History` tab in the referrals section.
There you will be able to see a list of all your withdrawals.

Commission amounts differ depending on the datacentre.
To see the commission earned for each data centre, please navigate to the `Rates` tab in the referrals section.

As mentioned above, referrals are earned based on usage, not based on user credit.
