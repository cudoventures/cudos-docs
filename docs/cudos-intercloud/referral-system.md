# CUDOS Intercloud Referral System

Intercloud users have the ability to refer other users with their referral code, or a referral link.
Benefits include:
- Referrers typically receive between 1 and 1.5% of the usage of all users they have referred.
- Withdrawals are received in FET tokens.
- The minimum withdrawal amount is $15.
- Referral balance that is not withdrawn can be used as platform credit.

Referrals only go one level at the moment -- you do not earn referral commissions on users that are referred by a user you have referred.
