# Time-limited Promotions
CUDOS Intercloud offers all its users different discounts and bonuses on all its offerings, particularly those who are active members of the ASI Alliance ecosystem.

## Staking Discounts
Any users staking FET tokens in the ASI Alliance Network will now get up to 5% off on any services purchased within Intercloud.
To calculate the amount staked, all the tokens delegated to validators in ASI Alliance for all Cosmos addresses connected to the account are aggregated.
Then, the discount is calculated as

$$
\mathrm{discount} = \mathrm{maxDiscount} \cdot \min\left(1,\left(\frac{\mathrm{stake}}{\mathrm{maxStake}}\right)^{\mathrm{exponent}}\right).
$$

The values used are

- maxDiscount = 5%.
- maxStake = 16,900.
- exponent = 0.3858.

Thus, with no stake the discount is zero, for 16.9k tokens staked or more the discount is 5%, and it increases slower than the square root in between.

For reference, some discount amounts for different stake numbers are:

| Staked amount | Discount |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 |
| 634 | 1.41% |
| 1,268 | 1.84% |
| 4,225 | 2.93% |
| 8,450 | 3.83% |
| 16,900	| 5% |

## Bonus Credit for FET Payments
Any deposits made in FET tokens are granted with an extra 5% credit.
The bonus credit is assigned after all network and routing fees are taken.

## Bonus Credit for Deposit Milestones
Thereâ€™s a tiered bonus system, to reward the most active users of the platform.
The more credit you add to the platform, the more you get back in your account as Intercloud balance, up to $12,000.
Please note that the credit that counts towards this milestone started counting on June 25, 2024; any credit an account had before will not count towards the milestones.
The different tiers are:

|Total credit deposited | Total bonus received | Bonus in tier | Cashback percentage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $1,000 | $20 | $20 | 2.00% |
| $5,000 | $120 | $100 | 2.40% |
| $10,000 | $320 | $200 | 3.20% |
