# CUDOS Intercloud

This is the user guide for the preliminary release of CUDOS Intercloud, an innovative service that allows users to access computing resources permissionlessly in a Web3 environment.

CUDOS Intercloud is a globally distributed service where virtual machine infrastructure provided by cloud providers can be seamlessly deployed. CUDOS Intercloud is powered by the [CUDOS blockchain network](https://www.cudos.org/mainnet/). 

This documentation focuses on the GUI side of the platform.
If you wish to interact with our platform through CLI or smart contract directly, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/t397SKqf4u).
