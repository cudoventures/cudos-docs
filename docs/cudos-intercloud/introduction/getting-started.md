# Getting Started

The first thing you’ll need to do is get yourself a [Keplr]((https://docs.cudos.org/docs/learn/concepts/wallets/keplr-create/)) or a [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) wallet, to log into the platform.
You can later add more addresses into your account, or remove addresses that are connected to it.

Once you’ve done that, you’ll need to fund your account with [any of the cryptocurrencies that we accept](https://docs.cudos.org/docs/cudos-intercloud/chains-currencies).
If you wish to top up your account with CUDOS tokens, here is another guide on how to get [them](https://docs.cudos.org/docs/governance/get-tokens/).
Please note that we only accept the native version of the CUDOS token for payments, at the moment.
If you are holding the ERC-20 version and would like to use it to purchase cloud infrastructure, you can move it to the CUDOS Network using the [CUDOS Bridge](https://bridge.cudos.org/).
