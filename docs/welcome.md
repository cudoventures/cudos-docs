## About CUDOS

CUDOS is a leading DePIN project that offers sustainable high performance computing infrastructure.
CUDOS is part of Cudo Ventures, the company behind [Cudo Compute](https://www.cudocompute.com/), the high performance GPU cloud that CUDOS Intercloud gets most of its resources from.

While CUDOS used to have an ERC-20 token and its own Cosmos chain, it [merged both of this with the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance](https://x.com/CUDOS_/status/1839754601920376851) (ASI Alliance), and is now part of the bigger ASI ecosystem as an Alliance member.
