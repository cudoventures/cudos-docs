#### "CUDOS strives to seamlessly integrate the ownership economy of Web3 with sustainable cloud infrastructure. By utilizing data centers and idle resources, we can power next-generation experiences in gaming, rendering, AI, metaverses, node infrastructure, and various decentralised applications."

___
**A Decentralised Application, or dApp, usually consists of two main components:**

1. The consensus-driven business logic and representation of value using tokens - this is built with **Smart Contracts** on chain.
2. The other component includes web frontends, game-rendering, blockchain data caching and indexing, AI model training etc. 

**CUDOS provides a one-stop-shop for both components:**

1. **CUDOS Network** is a Layer-1, CosmosSDK-based blockchain, with [CosmWasm](https://book.cosmwasm.com/) smart contracts written in [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
2. [CUDOS Intercloud](https://intercloud.cudos.org/) is a permissionless infrastructure for provisioning cloud resources from the Blockchain.
